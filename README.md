# conscious-leadership-chat-ai

> A simple, personal AI chatbot that brings the 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership to life,  powered entirely by **GitHub Models** and your own GitHub token. üéâ

## ‚ú® What This Is

This is a minimal, expressive demo app showing how you can spin up an AI-powered chat experience using nothing more than:

- Your own **GitHub account + Personal Access Token**
- GitHub‚Äôs **free Models API** (currently in preview)
- **Copilot** to write all your code

You write your prompts, manage them in the GitHub UI, and GitHub handles the inference pipeline. No OpenAI billing, no complex setup.

## üí° What It Does

Users write something about their day, and the app responds with a thoughtful, supportive message grounded in one of the [15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership](https://conscious.is/15-commitments). Think of it as a self-coaching moment, elevated by AI.

It‚Äôs great for moments of reflection, but also serves as a **starter kit** to show just how easy GitHub has made it to run personalized LLM applications.

## üîß Why I Made This

I‚Äôve done code bootcamps in Java and Ruby, but I have no prior experience with Python. I wanted to see:

- What can I build with AI using **GitHub Models**?
- How fast can I get it running with **just Copilot**?
- Can I host something useful that people might actually use?

The answer to all of the above: **yes**. This app came together through Copilot-generated scaffolding, edits, and chat assistance ‚Äî and GitHub Models is doing all the AI inference in real time behind the scenes.

## üîç Try It & Explore the Prompts

If you're curious about how the prompts actually work, GitHub has made it incredibly easy to see and edit them:

1. Go to the GitHub repo
2. Click the new **"Models"** tab
3. Choose the system or user prompt to view/edit in the UI

This makes collaborating on prompt design **way easier** ‚Äî especially if you want to fine-tune tone, behavior, or structure as a team.

I'll be making a video soon walking through how I'm using the Models tab to improve and manage my prompts using GitHub's new **prompt tooling and evaluations features**.
